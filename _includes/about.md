## About Me

Programming has been my passion since I was 11 years old. My love was born out of necessity; my brother hogged the computer all day long and I needed to use it. We found a computer out by the garbage and I was determined to get it working. Unfortunately, it only had a modem and we only had wireless. Several days and burnt cds later I finally compiled the driver for my new wireless card! I was hooked.

Ever since my I've been diving into any languages I can. I began with flash, for my 13th birthday I got a Java book read it cover to cover, and then quickly discovered python and fell in love with its simplicity. I spent most of high school skipping my other classes and going to the programming class instead. Now I work as a Senior Full Stack Developer, a dream I never thought would come true.

### My Current Journey

At work my life is surrounded by Java and Angular. But my heart belongs to the functional world. Learning new languages has always been my hobby and for the most part it was a quick process, until I found Clojure. Clojure was unlike anything I had seen before. Not only is it a lisp, but it is immutable. Being able to think in Clojure took my over a year. But at the end of that journey, my programming was forever changed.

After Clojure I found SICP.  I found Haskell. I discovered type theory. I began reading academic papers (check out my readings sections for some suggestions). My outlook on programming was forever changed.

### What I'm playing with

* Leading a book club at work going through SICP.
* Working on an incremental game implemented using core.async.
* Creating Json-Transformer a java library providing functional basics over json structures.
* Docker, its isolation and use for dev environments is powerful.
* Playing with Object Algebras.
* Implement clojure sequence abstractions using protomorphism
* Creating a [javascript multi-methods library](https://github.com/jimmyhmiller/multiple-methods)
* Any [random thing](https://github.com/jimmyhmiller/PlayGround) that pops into my head.

### What I'm interested in

* Rust is a language I really want to dive into.
* Eve is very interesting. I can't wait for Chris's talk at strangeloop.
* Elixir looks like a well designed language. I want to play with the actor model a bit.
* Scala is something I have done a bit, but would love to do more.
* Type Theory. I'd love to see a purely oop langauge with fully immutable objects, type inference, and row polymorphism instead of subtyping.
* Idris is a depedently type language. I have no idea where to start writing real programs in it.

### Contact
Email is the best way to contact me. I never really got into the whole social media thing.
