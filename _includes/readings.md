##Readings

Here are some of the my favorite papers, books, and I've decided to even include talks that I've found fascinating, thought provoking, or useful in some way. 

### [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)

This book is a classic. It is probably on more lists of top programming books than any other book. And there is a really good reason for that. SICP is a tour de force of interesting programming concept implemented in straight forward readable code. For example, without any language support they show how you can implement your own object system in about 10 lines of code. While SICP using mathematic examples through out, it is far from a purely academic book. This book is worth the time it takes to get through.

### [Learn You a Haskell for the Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
This is a great introduction to haskell. It is incredibly irreverent, funny, and yet insightful. Learn you as Haskell is certainly not a book for people who've never programmed before, but it is great for getting your first bearings in haskell. 

### [Propositions as Types](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf)

This paper is perhaps one of the best written papers I've read. The topic it covers may seem incredibly technical, yet it is written in a very approachable style. The papers start off with a bit of history, moves to explaination, and ends with a healthy dose of philosophy. I read this paper late at night and after putting it down laid down in bed wide-eyed thinking about what I had just learned. This is an incredibly important paper.

### [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

This is legitimately the best talk I've ever listened to. Rich Hickey is both a great speaker and a wonderful teacher. As in ever Rich talk, the talk is a walk through the dictionary. It shows how we've lost a distinction between things which are easy and those that are simple. Rich shows that once we have the proper definition of simple in place, we can begin to rethink our languages and system, redesigning them with truly simple designs.

### [Growing a Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0)

I won't give away the "gimmick" of this talk because it will ruin the affect. But Guy Steeles idea for this talk re-enforces his thesis tremendously. This talk is a scathing, yet perhaps the most fair critique I have heard.
