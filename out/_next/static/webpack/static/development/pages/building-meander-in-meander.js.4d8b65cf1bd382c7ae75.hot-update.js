The meander.epsilon compiler is really just converting between data structures, we read matches in as data, parse them as an ast, build a matrix based IR, build a more direct IR, do optimizations and deduplication, and then generate clojure code (also data).

Its direct, symbolic, pattern matching approach simplifies a great deal of what goes into writing a compiler for your own customer dsl. It gives you clear and concise code that lets you reason about your cases. As we've built out zeta we've found meander's structured approach to really help us understand our code and really give us a clear sense of what to do next. Give this technique a try the next time you have a dsl in mind. Why settle for an interpreter when meander makes it this easy to write a compiler?"));
