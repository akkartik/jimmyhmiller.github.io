Lindauer wants to suggest that Inscrutability and Lack of Control are much less of a concern when it comes to concept preservation than to re-engineering and de novo engineering efforts.

If we do this, others will be able to understand our ideas and the codebase will be properly maintainable. Yet, this never seems to happen in practice. As others begin to contribute to our codebase our concepts become lost. No longer do our interfaces mean what they once meant. No longer do our concepts drive changes in the codebase.

Writing clear variable and function names is fantastic and can certainly aid in comprehension. But no matter how clear our code is, it does not capture our concept completely. Our code underdetermines our concept. No matter what structure we give to our code, there will be multiple concepts of the code that are compatible with it.

Of course, our code underdetermines our concepts. That is why we document it, describe background, talk about edge cases, discuss possible future extensions.
