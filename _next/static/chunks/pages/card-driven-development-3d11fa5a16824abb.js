CDD is an umbrella term meant to encompass quite a few different development processes.

It encompasses formal or informal processes as long as they have a few things in common.'}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:'CDD is a way of approaching software development that involves a splitting of responsibilities. In CDD, there must be at least two groups, the first, often called "Engineering", is responsible for technical duties including writing code, maintaining code, and operational concerns like managing servers. The second group, often known as "Product" or informally "the business", is responsible for researching, detailing, and prioritizing what work needs to be done. Product gives work to Engineering, they prioritize what work will be done next, and they message out the status of the work to various interested parties.'}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"This split in responsibility means that the day-to-day work accomplished by Engineering and Product looks very different. Engineering, when operating well, is about shipping working software to customers, whereas Product's work is an act of delegation. This can often lead engineers to believe that Product does nothing, but this could not be further from the truth. Product's days are packed with work. Product's role involves being pulled in many directions, they must keep track of the work in progress, while continuously engaging with the various interested parties vying for their attention; attempting to get their party's particular needs worked on next.

In CDD this system is the card."}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"Cards are a place to describe work that needs to be done and in what order it should be done. Cards break work into small chunks, typically focused on functionality that some particular party would like. Cards serve as a meeting point for Product and Engineering. Product writes cards, prioritizes cards, and gives them to Engineering as work that needs to be done. Engineering then works in the order given by product. Sometimes this means taking multiple cards at a time and making a time commitment for their completion (often called a sprint). Other times cards are pulled in one by one as time and resources permit (this process is often referred to as a Kanban-style workflow)."}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:'As described here the card-making process only involves Product. In reality, there is usually a collaboration between Product and Engineering around cards. Typically cards are reviewed and discussed before they ever are handed to an Engineer to be worked on. Some of these cards may be "technical cards", cards created and owned by Engineering. With the exception of these technical cards though, cards are owned by Product.

The design decisions of past engineers provide deep constraints on how much effort a given change will take. The choice of a relational or non-relational datastore limits the sort of data-integrity constraints we can easily enforce, the library we have chosen for our frontend constrains our ability to support things like server-side rendering that may be needed for SSO considerations, and the decision of how to split (or not) our application into services constrains our deployment and delivery strategy, just to name a few examples."}),(0,s.jsx)(i.X6,{size:"2",text:"The Problem with Card Driven Development"}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"Card Driven Development, as I have defined it, is concerned primarily with a division of labor.
