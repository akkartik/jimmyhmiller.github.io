Lindauer wants to suggest that Inscrutability and Lack of Control are much less of a concern when it comes to concept preservation than to re-engineering and de novo engineering efforts.

Writing clear variable and function names is fantastic and can certainly aid in comprehension. But no matter how clear our code is, it does not capture our concept completely. Our code underdetermines our concept. No matter what structure we give to our code, there will be multiple concepts of the code that are compatible with it.
