What is crucially missing is the allowance for discovery to take center stage when it comes to planning. As engineers work to build a theory (by programming) their discoveries must be incorporated into the plan. But what mechanism is available in CDD for doing so? Well, the primary mechanism is the card. This is the communication tool of choice, it is the pre-requisite for getting work sanctioned."}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:"But here is where the problem starts. The card cannot serve the task of feedback that it has been tasked with. It is inadequate for a few reasons. First, the time horizon for feedback to be incorporated and for course correction to occur is too long. As engineers are programming, they might find that their theory was incorrect, that the work they had planned to do is no longer the correct choice. What should they do?

First, is it true that engineers are not given the flexibility to course correct without creating a card? Well, if the card is written the way many advocates of CDD recommend, it would seem no. CDD advocates often say that a card should be about detailing a concrete customer problem, rather than a particular solution. It is up to the team to determine how best to solve this problem."}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:"Here we can say a few things. First, it is readily admitted by most parties that achieving this goal is something must companies struggle with. So CDD as it is practiced, rather than in its ideal form still runs into this issue quite a bit. But we can go further than this. What problems make sense to tackle, what problems are meaningful depends on the theory we have. How many times have we done work where we solved a particular problem, and solved it well, only to find out our customers didn\u2019t use it? Many times, our customers themselves told us about this problem, will even admit it solves the problem as originally stated, but it turns out they were wrong about their needs. Setting forth a problem constrains our theories, if in the process of discovery we come up with a new theory that sets us on a new course with new problems, what are we do to given CDD?"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:"Next, I have acted as if the card is the only medium of communication available. If we view any guide on how to practice a CDD process, we will find this isn\u2019t accurate. The card is a starting point, it precedes the conversation. Planning is not about taking the card as given, it is about discussing the card and coming to an agreement as a team on the plan to move forward. And yet still this isn\u2019t enough to handle the discovery process. First, the card frames the discussion as does the planning meeting. The goal is to come to a decision for action, not to contemplate a theory. But even if this isn\u2019t a barrier, the card won\u2019t be adequate, because the knowledge that has been gained by the engineer might not be expressible for them. We can know all sorts of things we can\u2019t express. We can even teach others those things we cannot express. But the card is not the medium for doing so."}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:"Finally there are all sorts of different types of cards. What it might seem I am describing is a CDD process without the Spike card. The spike card is purpose built for the discovery process. It is a time-boxed card made for discover where the deliverable is the findings that the spike uncovered. And yet, this isn\u2019t adequate. The discover process is not a phase, it is not a time-boxed part of the process, it just is the process. If programming is theory building, then what has been relegated to a \u201cspike\u201d is really the main function we are performing, with code as a side-effect.
